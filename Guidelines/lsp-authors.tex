\chapter{Style rules for authors}

Authors can submit books after registering as an author at
\url{http://langsci-press.org/user/register}. \lsp only publishes books that are assigned to a
series. It is suggested that authors contact the series editor informally before an official submission.
The submission has to be in PDF format to make proper
reviewing (reference to page numbers) possible. The first submission does not have to correspond to
the format specification that is outlined in this chapter, but if it does this is good since it
enables series editors to get some idea about the length of the book and so on. If authors submit an
almost final version in the proper layout, this speeds up production, since comments on form can be
provided in the first reviewing steps.



The following sections describe the layout of various items that play a role in typesetting. Many of
these things are covered automatically by the Word Template\footnote{
\url{https://github.com/langsci/word}, 19.02.2014.
} or by our \latex classes\footnote{
\url{https://github.com/langsci/latex}, 19.02.2014.
}. Authors who start a new book project are strongly recommended to use \latex from the very beginning.


\section{Front matter}

Every book begins with a table of contents, labeled Contents or Table of contents. (However, the
table of contents may be preceded by a dedication page that contains a short dedication.) The table
of contents lists chapter titles, section headings and subsection headings, each preceded by its
number.  Next comes an optional section with notational conventions (perhaps labeled Abbreviations
and notational conventions).  This is followed by an optional section labeled Acknowledgements or
Preface.  (Note that there is no list of figures and no list of tables.) The introductory chapter is
chapter 1, even if it is short.  In edited volumes, there is an obligatory section called Notes on
contributors, with biosketches of all contributors (as is usual in OUP volumes). This follows the
table of contents directly, preceding the section with notational conventions.



\section{Back matter}

The last chapter is followed by an optional section with appendices (labeled Appendix A, Appendix B,
\ldots).  The appendices are followed by an obligatory section called Bibliography.  The book is
concluded by two or three indexes: an Author index (obligatory), a Subject index (obligatory), and a
Language index (advisable if the book talks about a larger number of languages).  

\section{Chapters}

Every book is divided into consecutively numbered chapters. In addition to chapters, a book may also
have superordinate parts (numbered I, II, III). Chapter numbering is not restarted within parts.




\section{Sections and headings}

All sections (= parts of chapters) have headings and are numbered. You may use structures with up to
six levels, that is there may be a section with the number 1.2.3.4.5.6.\footnote{
  See page~\pageref{sec-Chinese} for an actual use of subsubsections.%
} However, such elaborated
structures may be difficult for the readers, so there should be a good motivation for going beyond
three or four levels.

Sections and subsections must be minimally two and must be exhaustive, i.e. all text in a chapter
must belong to some section, and all text within a section must belong to some subsection (etc.). A
short intro paragraph is allowed by way of exception, as in the current section 3 (see the intro
paragraph above section 3.1).

Please write the headings of chapters and sections without special capitalization. This also applies
to the title (and subtitle) of the book itself and to the bibliographical references. Language
Science Press never uses special capitalization, as it potentially introduces ambiguity, and there
are no clear rules for special capitalization in English anyway.


\section{Emphasis and punctuation}

To emphasize terms, please use \emph{italics}. Boldface should be avoided if
possible. New terms should be set in {\sc small caps}.

EN-dashes are used for ranges (e.g.\ 1985–1995).

Double quotation marks can be used for distancing, as in the following:
\ea
This is sometimes called „pseudo-conservatism“, but I will not use this term here, as it could lead
to confusion.
\z
Single quotation marks are used exclusively for linguistic meanings, as in the following:
\ea
Latin habere ‚have’ is not cognate with Old English hafian ‚have’.
\z

\section{Glossed examples}

Please gloss all examples and provide them with translations. The glossing should be done according
to the Leipzig Glossing Rules. If you need special abbreviations that are not defined by the Leipzig
Glossing Rules\footnote{
\url{http://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/resources/glossing-rules.php}. 27.10.2013.
}
\todo{Martin: provide an example}, put them in a table immedeately before the first chapter of a
monograph. In case of edited volumes the tables with abbreviations should be placed immedeately
before the references.

The formating of linguistic examples in typological series follows the format that is used by the
World Atlas of Language Structures \citep{DM2013a-ed}: If there is just one example, the language name and references
follow the example number as in (\mex{1}):
{\def\exfont{\normalsize\itshape}
\ea\label{ex-typology}
{\rm Mising\il{Mising} \citep[69]{Prasad91a}}\\
\gll azɔ́në dɔ́luŋ\\
     small village\\ 
\glt `a small village' 
\z
If two examples with different numbers belong to the same language, the language name is provided in
both examples.\footnote{
  See examples (5) and (6) in the WALS online at \url{http://wals.info/chapter/87} for an example.
}
If an example consists of several subexamples, the language and references follow the letters as in
(\mex{1}):
\eal
\ex {\rm Apatani\il{Apanti} \citep[23]{Abraham85a}}\\
\gll aki atu\\ 
     dog small\\ 
\glt ‘the small dog’ 
\ex {\rm Temiar\il{Temiar} \citep[155]{Benjamin76a}}\\ 
\gll dēk mənūʔ\\
     house big\\
\glt ‘big house’ 
\zl
}

\section{Figures and tables}

Figures and tables should come with a caption. Captions are set below figures and above tables. 
Like headings, the caption should not use special capitalization.
Please number figures and
tables. The number should consist of the chapter number and a number that starts with one for every
new chapter. There has to be one counter for figures and another one for
tables. Figure~\vref{fig-example-fig-the-dog-barks} is an example of a figure and
Table~\vref{tab-example-croft} is an example of a table.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\caption{\label{fig-example-fig-the-dog-barks}An example of a figure: Analysis of the sentence \emph{The dog barks.}}
\end{figure}

`Verb'    & tense/aspect/mood auxiliary & forgrounded verb\\ 
\hline\hline
\end{tabularx}
}
\end{table}

\section{Footnotes}

Please use footnotes rather than endnotes. Footnotes go to the end of the clause after punctuation
unless they refer to a specific word or phrase.\footnote{
  This is an example of a footnote that refers to the whole clause.
}

Please do not use footnotes in tables or figures\footnote{
  This is a footnote that refers to the word \emph{figures}. If only there was something interesting
  to say about figures apart from the fact that they are floating objects.
} but attach them to the text preceding or following them.

\inlinetodostefan{Martin: [COMMENT: Manchmal braucht man solche Tabellen-internen Fußnoten; dann verwendet man manchmal Buchstaben a, b, c als Fußnotenzeichen]}


\section{Quotations}

If long passages are quoted, they should be indented and the quote should be followed by the exact reference:
\begin{quotation}
Precisely constructed models for linguistic structure can play an
important role, both negative and positive, in the process of discovery 
itself. By pushing a precise but inadequate formulation to
an unacceptable conclusion, we can often expose the exact source
of this inadequacy and, consequently, gain a deeper understanding
of the linguistic data. More positively, a formalized theory may 
automatically provide solutions for many problems other than those
for which it was explicitly designed. Obscure and intuition-bound
notions can neither lead to absurd conclusions nor provide new and
correct ones, and hence they fail to be useful in two important respects. 
I think that some of those linguists who have questioned
the value of precise and technical development of linguistic theory
have failed to recognize the productive potential in the method
of rigorously stating a proposed theory and applying it strictly to
linguistic material with no attempt to avoid unacceptable conclusions 
by ad hoc adjustments or loose formulation.
\citep[5]{Chomsky57a}
\end{quotation}
%
Short passages should be quoted inline using quotes: \citet[5]{Chomsky57a} stated that ``[o]bscure
  and intuition-bound notions can neither lead to absurd conclusions nor provide new and
correct ones''.

If you quote text that is not in the language of the book provide a translation. Short quotes should
be translated inline, long quotes should be translated in a footnote.

\section{Crossreferences in the text}

Please use the crossreferenceing mechanisms of your text editing/type setting software. Using such
crossreferencing mechanisms is less error-prone when you shift text blocks around and in addition
all these crossreferences will be turned into hyperlinks between document parts, which makes the
final documents much more useful.

%If you have numbered example sentence, please start with (1) for every new chapter.
%%
%% Alternatively, you may put the chapter number in front of the example number (thus starting with (7.1), (7.2), ... in chapter 7, for example).
%% [COMMENT: Bei Grammatiken ist es durchaus üblich, dass alle Beispiele im Buch durchnummeriert werden. Auch in Rießlers Arbeit sind die Beispiele komplett durchnummeriert. Ich bin mir nicht sicher, wie wichtig diese Regelung ist, und ob wir nicht Volldurchnummerierung auch erlauben sollten.]

Please use capitals if you refer to numbered chapters, sections, tables, figure, or footnotes: \emph{As we have shown in
  Section~3.1}, \emph{As Figure~3.5 shows}. Do not capitalize without a number: \emph{In the
  following section we will discuss}.
Depending on the series and the langauge the book is published in authors may also use the § sign
instead of the word \emph{Section}. So the above sentence would read: \emph{As we have shown in
  §3.1}.

\section{Citations and references}
\label{sec-references-authors}

A citation is author-year information (optionally with page number or other more detailed information) in the text. A bibliographical reference is metadata about a work that is cited.

If books or larger articles are cited for a smaller point, exact page numbers should be provided. This is both good for
authors since it helps them to keep track of their source and enables them to find and reread the
referenced passages and it is a good service to the readers.

We use the \emph{Unified Style Sheet for Linguistics}, which is described here:
\url{http://celxj.org/downloads/UnifiedStyleSheet.pdf}. The \bibtex file is contained in the \latex
classes that are used for typesetting \lsp books. Please deliver a \bibtex file with all your
references together with your submissions. \bibtex can be exported from all common bibliography
tools (We recommend BibDesk for the Mac and JabRef for all other platforms). Please make sure that
all \bibtex fields are complete. Please provide all first and last names of all authros and
editors. It is always possible to let a \bibtex style insert ``et~al.'', but of course it is
impossible to have the \bibtex style guess what the names of the editors are if this information is
not provided. For bipartite family names like ``von Stechow'', ``Van Eynde'', and ``de Hoop'' make sure that these
family names are contained in curly brackets. These authors will then be cited as
\citet{VanEynde2006a} and \citet{vonStechow84a}. Note that Dutch names like ``de Hoop'' are not treated differently from other surnames.

The references in your \bibtex file will be typeset correctly automatically. So, provided the
\bibtex file is correct, authors do not have to worry about this. But there are some things to
observe in the main text. Please cite as shown in Table~\ref{tab-citation}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{\label{tab-citation}Citation style for \lsp}
\centerline{%
\begin{tabular}{lp{9cm}}\hline\hline
citation type & example\\\hline
author & As \citet[215]{MZ85a} have shown\\
       & As \citet[215]{MZ85a} and \citet{Bloomfield33a} have shown\\

work   & This is not true \citep{Saussure16a,Bloomfield33a}.\\\hline\hline
\end{tabular}
}
\end{table}
\nocite{Bresnan82b}% something with an editor.

%% Table~\ref{tab-various-publication-types} provides examples for different publication types (book,
%% journal article, paper in an edited volume, and so on). Please refer to the bibliography at the end
%% of this book to see how the respective items are formated.

If you have an enumeration of references in the text as in \emph{As X, Y, and Z have shown}, please use
the normal punctuation of the respective language rather than special markup like `;'.

If you refer to regions in a text, for instance 111--112, please do not use 111f.\ or 111ff.\ but provide the
full information.

\section{Special terms}

If you refer to special terms, please use italics as in (\mex{1}):
\ea
I use the term \emph{nominative} for \ldots
\z

\section{Interpunction}

Please use interpunction consistently. If you use initial adverbial clauses, please use commas:
\emph{When referring to such nominatives, I use \ldots}.


\section{Academic \emph{we}}

Monographs and articles that are authored by a single author should use the pronoun \emph{I} rather
than \emph{we} as in \emph{As we showed in Section~3}.

\section{Special guidelines for edited volumes}


Some special rules apply to the chapter of edited volumes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Each paper has its own list of references (unnumbered section labeled References).
\item Each paper should start with a short abstract, printed in smaller typeface like a block quotation.
\item A paper may have a special unnumbered section Acknowledgements just after the last numbered section. This is preferable to putting the acknowledgements into the footnotes.
\item A paper may have a special unnumbered section Abbreviations (or similar) just before the References. This is strongly preferred to listing the abbreviations in a fotnote.
\item Chapter numbers should not be used in numbering tables and figures within such chapters.
\end{itemize}


\section{Checklist}

The following is a general checklist for authors. Author who use \latex should also consult the
checklist for advanced authors/typesetters in Section~\ref{sec-check-typesetters}.
