\chapter{General information on Language Science Press}


\section{Background and motivation}

Language Science Press is a book imprint that publishes high-quality books in the field of academic linguistics. It was founded in 2013, growing out of the initiative ``Open-Access Books for Linguistics'' (OALI) that was started by Stefan Müller (and other linguists at FU Berlin) and joined by Martin Haspelmath. After its first launch in August 2012, it quickly found over 100 prominent supporters from various subfields of linguistics and a range of different countries.

The problem to which this initiative responded was the increasing costs of linguistics books, which has come to contrast more and more with the ease with which files can be shared \citep{MuellerOA}. Increasingly, it seems that most of what the traditional publishers add to the scientists' work is the prestige of an imprint label \citep{Haspelmath2012a}, but this is something that is ultimately created by the scientists as well.

Thus, we decided to found a new imprint (\lsp) dedicated to publishing high-quality books which exist primarily in electronic form. Printed copies will be available through print-on-demand services. This imprint will be owned and run by scholars, and neither authors nor readers will be charged. The required work (reviewing, proofreading, typesetting) will be organized and carried out by the scholars themselves.

Language Science Press is associated with the FU Berlin and is coordinated by Stefan Müller and Martin Haspelmath.
